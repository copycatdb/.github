# 🐱 CopyCat Code of Conduct

*The Litter Box Rules*

---

## The Short Version

1. **Be kind.** Treat others the way a well-socialized cat treats its favorite human.
2. **Be helpful.** If someone's stuck, lend a paw.
3. **Don't be a jerk.** Hissing is for cats, not contributors.

## The Longer Version

### 🐾 Expected Behavior

- **Be welcoming.** Every contributor was new once. Remember what that felt like.
- **Be respectful.** Disagree with ideas, not people. "I think this approach has issues because..." not "this is stupid."
- **Be constructive.** Criticism is fine — make it actionable. "This could be improved by..." beats "this is bad."
- **Be patient.** Not everyone has the same experience level, timezone, or first language. Give people grace.
- **Assume good intentions.** Most people are trying to help. Start from there.
- **Give credit.** If someone's idea helped you, say so.

### 🙀 Unacceptable Behavior

- **Harassment** of any kind — personal attacks, slurs, unwelcome sexual attention, stalking, doxxing
- **Trolling** — deliberate provocation, bad-faith arguments, sea-lioning
- **Gatekeeping** — "well actually"-ing newcomers, dismissing questions as beneath you
- **Spam** — self-promotion, off-topic content, repeated unwanted messages
- **Being a bully** — using seniority, expertise, or position to intimidate others

In cat terms: no scratching, no marking territory on other people's stuff, no knocking things off tables just to watch them break.

## 🧶 Scope

This applies everywhere CopyCat lives:

- GitHub repos (issues, PRs, discussions, code review)
- Any CopyCat community channels (Discord, forums, etc.)
- Representing CopyCat at events or in public

## 🚨 Enforcement

If someone violates this Code of Conduct:

1. **First offense:** A friendly reminder. Everyone has bad days.
2. **Repeated or serious violations:** Temporary or permanent ban from CopyCat spaces.
3. **Egregious behavior:** Immediate ban. Some things don't get second chances.

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- **Email:** Report to the maintainer (contact info in the org profile)
- **GitHub:** Use the "Report" feature on any comment
- **DM:** Reach out to `@tinkeringforfun` directly

Reports are handled confidentially. We take this seriously, even if the rest of our project has cat puns in it.

## 🐈 The Spirit of the Thing

We're building open-source tools because we believe software is better when people work together. This Code of Conduct exists to make sure "working together" stays fun, safe, and productive for everyone.

Be the kind of contributor you'd want on your own project. That's really all we're asking.
