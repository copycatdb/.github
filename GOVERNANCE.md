# 🏛️ CopyCat Governance

*Or: "How this cat herding operation actually works"*

This document describes how the CopyCat project is governed, how decisions are made, and — importantly — what will never happen.

---

## 🐱 What CopyCat Is

CopyCat is an **independent, community-owned open-source project** building a complete ecosystem of tools for SQL Server. It is not owned by, affiliated with, controlled by, or endorsed by any corporation.

It was started by [tinkeringforfun](https://github.com/tinkeringforfun) because SQL Server deserved better open-source tooling and nobody else was building it. It remains independent because that's the only way to build something truly for the community.

## 🏗️ Decision Making

### Current Structure

- **Benevolent Dictator For Now (BDFN):** tinkeringforfun — final call on direction, architecture, and releases
- **Community input:** Issues, Discussions, and PRs are where decisions get shaped. The BDFN listens. Seriously.
- **Consensus preferred:** For anything significant, we aim for rough consensus. The dictator part is a tiebreaker, not a management style.

### How Decisions Get Made

1. **Small stuff** (bug fixes, minor features): Just open a PR. If it's good, it gets merged.
2. **Medium stuff** (new features, API changes): Open a Discussion first. Let the community weigh in. Then PR.
3. **Big stuff** (new repos, architectural changes, governance changes): Discussion + explicit sign-off from the BDFN + reasonable community feedback period.

This is inspired by how projects like curl and SQLite operate: a clear maintainer with strong community engagement, not design-by-committee, not corporate-controlled.

## 🔒 The Independence Clause

This is the important part. Read it carefully.

**CopyCat will never be:**

- ❌ Acquired by any corporation
- ❌ Transferred to any corporate entity or corporate-controlled foundation
- ❌ Subsumed into another project as a component
- ❌ Relicensed under a non-open-source license
- ❌ Made to require a CLA that transfers copyright

**CopyCat will always be:**

- ✅ Independent and community-owned
- ✅ MIT licensed
- ✅ Free to use, modify, and distribute
- ✅ Governed by its contributors, not shareholders

This isn't negotiable. It's not up for discussion. It's not a starting position for a conversation. It's a line in the sand, drawn with a paw.

---

## 🔄 Succession

Life happens. If tinkeringforfun can't continue maintaining CopyCat:

1. **Governance transfers to the community** — specifically, to active maintainers and contributors
2. **Governance does NOT transfer to any corporation** — not even a friendly one, not even one that offers money
3. **A group of 3+ active contributors** will form a temporary steering committee
4. **The steering committee** will establish whatever governance structure the community decides on
5. **The Independence Clause still applies** — no future governance structure can override it

The project belongs to the people who build it and use it. Full stop.

## 🤝 What We Want From Corporations

We're not anti-corporate. We're pro-independence. There's a difference.

### What We'd Love to See (from Microsoft or anyone)

- **Use CopyCat tools.** That's why we built them.
- **Contribute code.** PRs from corporate developers are welcome and reviewed like any other.
- **Adopt our ideas.** If the RowWriter trait pattern from tabby inspires something in an official driver, that's a win for everyone. Take it. Seriously.
- **File issues.** You probably have use cases we haven't thought of.
- **Sponsor development.** GitHub Sponsors, grants, bounties — financial support is welcome and appreciated.
- **Tell people about us.** Blog posts, conference talks, internal recommendations.
- **Improve your own tools.** Competition makes everyone better. If CopyCat inspires Microsoft to improve their official tooling, the SQL Server community wins.

### What We Don't Want

- **Acquisition offers.** We're not for sale. Not now, not ever. Don't ask.
- **Embrace, extend, extinguish.** We know the history. We've read the memos. We're not naive, and we're not worried — because we're MIT licensed and community-owned. Fork us if you want. You can't kill what you don't control.
- **"Partnership" that means control.** If a partnership doesn't work with the Independence Clause above, it's not a partnership we want.
- **Pressure to change direction** to suit corporate roadmaps. We set our own priorities based on what the community needs.

We're building this in the open because we believe SQL Server tooling should be a community effort, not a corporate monopoly. Come build with us. Just don't try to buy the building.

## 💰 Funding

CopyCat currently operates on volunteer time and energy. We welcome financial support through:

- GitHub Sponsors
- Corporate sponsorship (with no governance strings attached)
- Grants from open-source foundations
- Bounties for specific features or bugs

Sponsors get gratitude, recognition, and good karma. They do not get governance power, veto rights, or influence over project direction. Money buys appreciation, not control.

## 📝 Changing This Document

This governance document can be changed through the standard decision-making process (Discussion + BDFN approval + community feedback).

**Exception:** The Independence Clause and Succession sections cannot be changed to weaken community ownership or enable corporate acquisition. These are permanent. They're the whole point.

---

## 🐈 In Summary

CopyCat is built by the community, for the community. Corporations are welcome as participants, contributors, sponsors, and enthusiasts. They are not welcome as owners.

We're friendly cats, but we have claws. 🐾
