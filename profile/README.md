# 🐱 CopyCat

**SQL Server deserves a proper open-source ecosystem. We're building it.**

CopyCat is an independent, community-owned project creating the tools that SQL Server developers have been waiting for — the kind of ecosystem Postgres users have enjoyed for years. We believe great databases deserve great open-source tooling, and we're not waiting for permission to build it.

Everything is MIT licensed. Everything is cat-themed. We regret nothing.

## 🧶 Philosophy

**Independent.** CopyCat is not owned by, affiliated with, or endorsed by any corporation. It's a community project built by people who love databases and think SQL Server deserves better open-source tooling.

**Ideas flow freely.** We learn from Postgres tooling, from Microsoft's official drivers, from everywhere good ideas live. If someone at Microsoft sees a pattern in CopyCat they want to adopt — fantastic, that's the point. If we see something clever in an official driver — we'll tip our hat and use it. Open source means open in every direction.

**Community-owned.** Read our [Governance doc](../GOVERNANCE.md). We welcome corporate contributions and sponsorship. We will never be acquired. This is our sandbox and everyone's invited to play, but nobody gets to take the sandbox home.
